# BlockChain-Project
First BlockChain Project In this project user can be able to book a vacant hotel room for 2 ethers. If a person pays less than asked amount the booking gets cacelled and if a person tries to book a booked hotel room then too it tells the user that "Room is Occupied!". Also you can link this to your MetaMask wallet and directly perform transactions through it.
