# BlockChain-Project
## First BlockChain Project In this project user can be able to book a vacant hotel room for 2 ethers. If a person pays less than asked amount the booking gets cancelled and if a person tries to book a booked hotel room then it reverts back the payment transaction and gives message as "Room is Occupied!". 
### Also you can link this to your MetaMask wallet and directly perform transactions through it.
